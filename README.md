Dart port of https://github.com/Rich-Harris/headless-qr

Why? There are more established qr libraries for Dart, I was
porting the JS one to some other language but thought
first turning this one into Dart can make that work easier
so this isn't that serious library but feel free to use
and report issues to it.
